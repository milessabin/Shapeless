/**
 * An enhanced alternative to `Predef.implicitly`.
 *
 * Used as a term `the[T]` yields the unique implicit value of type `T` in the current
 * implicit scope, if any. It is a compile time error if there is no such value. Its
 * primary advantage over `Predef.implicitly` is that it will preserve any refinement that
 * the implicit definition has, resulting in more precisely typed, and hence often more
 * useful, values,
 *
 * {{{
 * scala> trait Foo { type T ; val t: T }
 * defined trait Foo
 *
 * scala> implicit val intFoo: Foo { type T = Int } = new Foo { type T = Int ; val t = 23 }
 * intFoo: Foo{type T = Int} = \$anon\$1@6067b682
 *
 * scala> implicitly[Foo].t  // implicitly loses precision
 * res0: Foo#T = 23
 *
 * scala> implicitly[Foo].t+13
 * <console>:13: error: type mismatch;
 *  found   : Int(13)
 *  required: String
 *               implicitly[Foo].t+13
 *                                 ^
 *
 * scala> the[Foo].t         // the retains it
 * res1: Int = 23
 *
 * scala> the[Foo].t+13
 * res2: Int = 36
 * }}}
 *
 * Unlike `implicitly`, `the` can also be used in type position, thanks to a trick
 * due to Denys Shabalin (@den_sh) and Eugene Burmako (@xeno_by). Here we use a
 * combination of `selectDynamic` and backticks to embed a type in a path which
 * appears to the compiler as stable,
 *
 * {{{
 * scala> val i: implicitly[Foo].T = 23  // syntax error
 * <console>:1: error: ';' expected but '.' found.
 *        val i: implicitly[Foo].T = 23
 *                              ^
