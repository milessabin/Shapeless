shapeless : An exploration of generic/polytypic programming in Scala
====================================================================

shapeless is an exploration of generic (aka polytypic) programming in Scala
derived from the various talks I [(Miles Sabin)](http://goo.gl/oBCzn) have
given over the course of 2011 on implementing [scrap your boilerplate]
(http://goo.gl/KmfVG) and [higher rank polymorphism](http://goo.gl/zGRQ7) in
Scala.

In the new year I'll be [posting](http://www.chuusai.com/blog) a (long
overdue) series of articles on the implementation techniques used: heavily 
type class based, with essential use of dependent types at various
junctures, which together enable the relatively smooth encoding of type level
functions. In the meantime you'll find Olivera, Moors and Odersky [Type
Classes as Object and Implicits](http://goo.gl/ZbcxY) useful background
material.

There is a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/group/shapeless-dev)
for discussion around generic programming in Scala in general and
shapeless in particular. 

Selected highlights of shapeless include,

* A new encoding of polymorphic function values which optionally supports
  type specific cases, and which is interoperable with Scala's ordinary
  monomorphic function values.
  
```scala
    // choose is a function from Sets to Options with no type specific cases
    object choose extends (Set ~> Option) {
      def default[T](s : Set[T]) = s.headOption 
    }

    // choose is convertible to an ordinary monomorphic function value
    val lo = List(Set(1, 3, 5), Set(2, 4, 6)) map choose
    lo == List(Option(1), Option(2))

    // size is a function from values of arbitrary type to a 'size' which is
    // defined via type specific cases
    object size extends (Id ~> Const[Int]#λ) {
      def default[T](t : T) = 1
    }
    implicit def sizeInt = size.λ[Int](x => 1)
    implicit def sizeString = size.λ[String](s => s.length)
    implicit def sizeList[T] = size.λ[List[T]](l => l.length)
    implicit def sizeOption[T](implicit cases : size.λ[T]) =
      size.λ[Option[T]](t => 1+size(t.get))
    implicit def sizeTuple[T, U](implicit st : size.λ[T], su : size.λ[U]) =
      size.λ[(T, U)](t => size(t._1)+size(t._2))

    size(23) == 1
    size("foo") == 3
    size((23, "foo")) == 4
```

* An implementation of [Scrap your Boilerplate with Class](http://goo.gl/pR1OV)
  which provides generic map and fold operations over arbitrarily nested data
  structures,
  
```scala
    val nested = List(Option(List(Option(List(Option(23))))))
    
    val succ = everywhere(inc)(nested)
    succ == List(Option(List(Option(List(Option(24))))))
```

* A `Typeable` type class which provides a type safe cast operation.

```scala
    val a : Any = List(Vector("foo", "bar", "baz"), Vector("wibble"))
    
    val lvs : Option[List[Vector[String]]] = a.cast[List[Vector[String]]]
    lvs.isDefined == true

    val lvi : Option[List[Vector[Int]]] = a.cast[List[Vector[Int]]]
    lvi.isEmpty == true
```

* The mother of all Scala `HList`'s, which amongst other things,
+ is covariant.

```scala
    trait Fruit
    case class Apple() extends Fruit
    case class Pear() extends Fruit
    
    type FFFF = Fruit :: Fruit :: Fruit :: Fruit :: HNil
    type APAP = Apple :: Pear :: Apple :: Pear :: HNil
    
    val a : Apple = Apple()
    val p : Pear = Pear()
    
    val apap : APAP = a :: p :: a :: p :: HNil
    val ffff : FFFF = apap  // APAP <: FFFF 
```

+ has a map operation, applying a polymorphic function value (possibly
  with type specific cases) across its elements. This means that it
  subsumes both typical `HList`'s and also `KList`'s (`HList`'s whose
  elements share a common outer type constructor).
      
```scala
    type SISS = Set[Int] :: Set[String] :: HNil
    type OIOS = Option[Int] :: Option[String] :: HNil
    
    val sets : SISS = Set(1) :: Set("foo") :: HNil
    val opts : OIOS = sets map choose
    opts == Option(1) :: Option("foo") :: HNil 
```

+ has a zipper for traversal and persistent update.
    
```scala
    val l = 1 :: "foo" :: 3.0 :: HNil

    val l2 = l.toZipper.right.put("wibble", 45).toHList
    l2 == 1 :: ("wibble", 45) :: 3.0 :: HNil
  
    val l3 = l.toZipper.right.delete.toHList
    l3 == 1 :: 3.0 :: HNil

    val l4 = l.toZipper.last.left.insert("bar").toHList
    l4 == 1 :: "foo" :: "bar" :: 3.0 :: HNil, l5)
```
    
+ has a `unify` operation which converts it to an `HList` of elements
  of the least upper bound of the original types.
      
```scala
    val ffff = apap.unify // type inferred as FFFF
```
      
+ supports conversion to an ordinary Scala `List` of elements of the
  least upper bound of the original types.
      
```scala
    val lf = apap.toList  // type inferred as List[Fruit]
    lf == List(a, p, a, p)
```
      
+ has a `Typeable` type class instance, allowing, eg. vanilla
 `List[Any]`'s or `HList`'s with elements of type `Any` to be safely
  cast to precisely typed `HList`'s.
      
```scala
    val ffff : FFFF = apap.unify               // discard precise typing 
    val apap2 : Option[APAP] = ffff.cast[APAP] // reestablish precise typing
    apap2.get == apap  
```
      
These last three bullets make this `HList` dramatically more practically
useful than `HList`'s are typically thought to be: normally the full
type information required to work with them is too fragile to cross subtyping
or I/O boundaries. This implementation supports the discarding of precise
information where necessary (eg. to serialize a precisely typed record after
construction), and its later reconstruction (eg. a weakly typed deserialized
record with a known schema can have it's precise typing reestabilished).

* Conversions between tuples and `HList`'s, and between ordinary Scala
  functions of arbitrary arity and functions which take a single
  corresponding `HList` argument. One application of this is the `liftO`
  function which lifts an ordinary function of arbitrary arity into `Option`.
  
```scala
    // Round trip from tuple to HList and back
    val t1 = (23, "foo", 2.0, true)
    
    val l1 = t1.hlisted
    h1 == 23 :: "foo" :: 2.0 :: true :: HNil
    
    val t2 = l1.tupled
    t1 == t2
    
    // Lift these ordinary Scala function values into Option 
    val sum : (Int, Int) => Int = _ + _
    val prd : (Int, Int, Int) => Int = _ * _ * _
    
    // Nb. liftO abstracts over the arity of its function arguments 
    val sumO = liftO(sum) // (Option[Int], Option[Int]) => Option[Int]
    val prdO = liftO(prd) // (Option[Int], Option[Int], Option[Int]) => Option[Int]

    val s1 = sumO(Some(1), Some(2))
    s1 == Option(3)

    val s2 = sumO(Some(1), None)
    s2 == None

    val p1 = prdO(Some(2), Some(3), Some(4))
    p1 == Option(24)

    val p2 = prdO(Some(2), None, Some(4))
    p2 == None
```
      
The library is targetted at Scala 2.10-SNAPSHOT by default, but currently
should build against Scala 2.9.1.final with the `-Ydependent-method-types`
switch enabled. I make no promises that it'll continue to build with 2.9.x,
or even vanilla Scala 2.10-SNAPSHOT: in 2012 I plan to investigate, amongst
other things, what can be done with [singleton types for literal values]
(http://goo.gl/U18kK) ... at a minimum they would make the clunky encoding
of type level natural numbers (in `shapeless/nat.scala`) redundant, and
might enable a whole lot more.

* Collection types with statically known sizes. These can prevent runtime
  errors that would result from attempting to take the head of an empty list,
  and can also verify more complex and useful relationships. 

```scala
    def row(cols : Seq[String]) = cols.mkString("\"", "\", \"", "\"")
    def csv[N <: Nat]
      (hdrs : Sized[Seq[String], N],
       rows : List[Sized[Seq[String], N]]) = row(hdrs) :: rows.map(row(_))

    val hdrs = Sized("Title", "Author")
    val rows = List(
      Sized("Types and Programming Languages", "Benjamin Pierce"),
      Sized("The Implementation of Functional Programming Languages", "Simon Peyton-Jones")
    )
  
    // hdrs and rows statically known to have the name number of columns
    val formatted = csv(hdrs, rows)
    formatted foreach println                               // Compiles
    
    println
    
    // extendedHdrs has the wrong number of columns for rows
    val extendedHdrs = Sized("Title", "Author", "ISBN")
    val badFormatted = csv(extendedHdrs, rows)             // Does not compile
```

Building
--------

shapeless is built using SBT. On Linux and Mac OS run the `sbt` script and
perform the `compile` task.

Currently (21st Jan 2011) there is an incompatibility between SBT and
scala/master. While we're waiting for an SBT update you can either locally
modify your SBT installation as described
[here](https://groups.google.com/d/topic/simple-build-tool/ydKd83jbVX4/discussion),
or you can build with Scala 2.9.1 by running the `sbt` script with the `-29`
command line switch or by executing `++ 2.9.1` at the SBT prompt.


Eclipse project metadata can be generated by performing the `eclipse` task
followed by the `compile-inputs` task. If you're working with Eclipse I 
recommend using the [nightly builds relative to Scala master](http://goo.gl/iRgyc).

Testing
-------

shapeless comes with a collection of JUnit tests which exercise most of its
features. To run, perform the sbt `test` task.
