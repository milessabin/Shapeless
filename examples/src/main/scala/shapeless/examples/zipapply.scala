      * The result type can also be inferred at a function call site, using ZipApply.Aux — this allows you to use other
      * ops with type inference in between. Here's a neat function that will take two functions of HLists and compose
      * each element. It also takes an HLists of arguments, which must be compatible with the first HList of functions.
      * The composed functions are applied to the arguments, and we get an HList of the results of those. If you try
      * to call this function on two HLists of functions that won't compose, or with arguments that don't map to the
      * first HList of functions, you'll get a compile time error at that call site. Isn't it great?
      *
      * The arguments:
      * @param f1 An HList of functions
      * @param f2 Another HList of functions — each element must be composable with the corresponding element of f1
      * @param a  An HList of arguments — each element must be of the input type of the corresponding function from f1
      *
      * The implicits used:
      * @param zip        A [[shapeless.ops.hlist.Zip]] instance which allows us to zip f1 and f2, giving an HList with
      *                   the corresponding elements from each f1 and f2 as a [[scala.Tuple2]] - i.e.
      *                        (f1.head, f2.head) :: (f1.drop(1).head, f2.drop(1).head) ... :: HNil
      * @param mapCompose A [[shapeless.ops.hlist.Mapper]] instance which allows us to map the output of `zip` with the
      *                   [[compose]] poly function (defined at the bottom of this file)
      * @param zipApply   A [[shapeless.ops.hlist.ZipApply]] instance which will perform the application of the composed
      *                   functions. Note the use of `Aux` to infer the result type.
      *
      * And the type parameters:
      * @tparam Functions1 The type of the first [[HList]] of functions. This can be inferred because `inferenceExample`
      *                    takes an argument of this type.
      * @tparam Functions2 The type of the second [[HList]] of functions. This can be inferred for the same reason.
      * @tparam Arguments  The type of the [[HList]] of arguments. Again, this can be inferred since it must be concrete
      *                    at the call site.
      * @tparam FCombined  The type of the [[HList]] of pairs zipped from `Functions1` and `Functions2`. This gets
      *                    inferred thanks to the use of [[shapeless.ops.hlist.Zip.Aux]].
      * @tparam FComposed  The type of the [[HList]] of composed functions from `Functions1` and `Functions2`. This
      *                    gets inferred thanks to the use of [[shapeless.ops.hlist.Mapper.Aux]].
      * @tparam Output     The type of the [[HList]] of results from applying `FComposed` to `Arguments`. This gets
      *                    inferred thanks to the use of [[shapeless.ops.hlist.ZipApply.Aux]].
      *
      * @return The results of applying the composed functions to the corresponding arguments, as an HList.
